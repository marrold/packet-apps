5	VALLEY TO ONE SIDE.
6	YOU ARE IN OPEN FOREST NEAR BOTH A
6	VALLEY AND A ROAD.
7	AT YOUR FEET ALL THE WATER OF THE
7	STREAM SPLASHES INTO A 2-INCH SLIT
7	IN THE ROCK.  DOWNSTREAM THE STREAMBED
7	IS BARE ROCK.
8	YOU ARE IN A 20-FOOT DEPRESSION FLOORED
8	WITH BARE DIRT.  SET INTO THE DIRT IS A
8	STRONG STEEL GRATE MOUNTED IN CONCRETE.
8	A DRY STREAMBED LEADS INTO THE

15	SIDE.  NEARBY, A WIDE STONE STAIRCASE
15	LEADS DOWNWARD.  THE HALL IS FILLED
15	WITH WISPS OF WHITE MIST SWAYING TO AND
15	FRO ALMOST AS IF ALIVE.  A COLD WIND
15	BLOWS UP THE STAIRCASE.  THERE IS A
15	PASSAGE AT THE TOP OF A DOME BEHIND
15	YOU.
16	THE CRACK IS FAR TOO SMALL FOR YOU TO
16	FOLLOW.
17	YOU ARE ON THE EAST BANK OF A FISSURE
17	SLICING CLEAR ACROSS THE HALL.  THE
17	MIST IS QUITE THICK HERE, AND THE
17	FISSURE IS TOO WIDE TO JUMP.

35	OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF WHITE
35	MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT,
35	BECOMING THICKER TO THE RIGHT.  MARKS
35	IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD
35	SEEM TO INDICATE THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN
35	HERE RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT

91	CLIMB UP.  THERE IS A PASSAGE LEADING
91	BACK TO THE NORTH.
92	YOU ARE IN THE GIANT ROOM.  THE CEILING
92	HERE IS TOO HIGH UP FOR YOUR LAMP TO
92	SHOW IT.  CAVERNOUS PASSAGES LEAD EAST,
92	NORTH, AND SOUTH.  ON THE WEST WALL IS
92	SCRAWLED THE INSCRIPTION, "FEE FIE FOE
92	FOO" [SIC].

98	BELOW, THROUGH A HEAVY WHITE MIST,
98	STRANGE SPLASHING NOISES CAN BE HEARD.
98	THE MIST RISES UP THROUGH A FISSURE IN
98	THE CEILING.  THE PATH EXITS TO THE
98	SOUTH AND WEST.
99	YOU ARE IN AN ALCOVE.  A SMALL NW PATH
99	SEEMS TO WIDEN AFTER A SHORT DISTANCE.
99	AN EXTREMELY TIGHT TUNNEL LEADS EAST.

105	FEET ACROSS.
106	YOU ARE IN AN ANTEROOM LEADING TO A
106	LARGE PASSAGE TO THE EAST.  SMALL
106	PASSAGES GO WEST AND UP.  THE REMNANTS
106	OF RECENT DIGGING ARE EVIDENT.  A SIGN
106	IN MIDAIR HERE SAYS "CAVE UNDER

109	YOU ARE IN A NORTH/SOUTH CANYON ABOUT
109	25 FEET ACROSS.  THE FLOOR IS COVERED
109	BY WHITE MIST SEEPING IN FROM THE
109	NORTH.  THE WALLS EXTEND UPWARD FOR
109	WELL OVER 100 FEET.  SUSPENDED FROM SOME
109	UNSEEN POINT FAR ABOVE YOU, AN ENORMOUS
109	TWO-SIDED MIRROR IS HANGING PARALLEL TO
109	AND MIDWAY BETWEEN THE CANYON WALLS.
109	(THE MIRROR IS OBVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR
109	THE USE OF THE DWARVES, WHO AS YOU KNOW,
109	ARE EXTREMELY VAIN.)  A SMALL WINDOW
109	CAN BE SEEN IN EITHER WALL, SOME FIFTY
109	FEET UP.
110	YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A
110	HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF
110	SIGHT.  A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE
110	OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF WHITE
110	MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT,
110	BECOMING THICKER TO THE LEFT.  MARKS IN
110	THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM
110	TO INDICATE THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE
110	RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM
110	YOU AND 25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR
110	WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.  A
110	SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE
110	PEERING BACK AT YOU.
111	A LARGE STALACTITE EXTENDS FROM THE
111	ROOF AND ALMOST REACHES THE FLOOR
111	BELOW.  YOU COULD CLIMB DOWN IT, AND
111	JUMP FROM IT TO THE FLOOR, BUT HAVING
111	DONE SO YOU WOULD BE UNABLE TO REACH IT
111	TO CLIMB BACK UP.
112	YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTING
112	PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
113	YOU ARE AT THE EDGE OF A LARGE
113	UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR.  AN OPAQUE CLOUD
113	OF WHITE MIST FILLS THE ROOM AND RISES
113	RAPIDLY UPWARD.  THE LAKE IS FED BY A
113	STREAM, WHICH TUMBLES OUT OF A HOLE IN
113	THE WALL ABOUT 10 FEET OVERHEAD AND
113	SPLASHES NOISILY INTO THE WATER
113	SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE MIST.  THE ONLY
113	PASSAGE GOES BACK TOWARD THE SOUTH.
114	DEAD END
115	YOU ARE AT THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
115	IMMENSE ROOM, EVEN LARGER THAN THE
115	GIANT ROOM.  IT APPEARS TO BE A
115	REPOSITORY FOR THE "ADVENTURE" PROGRAM.
115	MASSIVE TORCHES FAR OVERHEAD BATHE THE
115	ROOM WITH SMOKY YELLOW LIGHT.
115	SCATTERED ABOUT YOU CAN BE SEEN A PILE
115	OF BOTTLES (ALL OF THEM EMPTY), A
115	NURSERY OF YOUNG BEANSTALKS MURMURING
115	QUIETLY, A BED OF OYSTERS, A BUNDLE OF
115	BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY STARS ON THEIR
115	ENDS, AND A COLLECTION OF BRASS
115	LANTERNS.  OFF TO ONE SIDE A GREAT MANY
115	DWARVES ARE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR,
115	SNORING LOUDLY.  A SIGN NEARBY READS:
115	"DO NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!"  AN
115	IMMENSE MIRROR IS HANGING AGAINST ONE
115	WALL, AND STRETCHES TO THE OTHER END OF
115	THE ROOM, WHERE VARIOUS OTHER SUNDRY
115	OBJECTS CAN BE GLIMPSED DIMLY IN THE
115	DISTANCE.
116	YOU ARE AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF THE
116	REPOSITORY.  TO ONE SIDE IS A PIT FULL
116	OF FIERCE GREEN SNAKES.  ON THE OTHER
116	SIDE IS A ROW OF SMALL WICKER CAGES,
116	EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A LITTLE SULKING
116	BIRD.  IN ONE CORNER IS A BUNDLE OF
116	BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY MARKS ON THEIR
116	ENDS.  A LARGE NUMBER OF VELVET PILLOWS
116	ARE SCATTERED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR.  A
116	VAST MIRROR STRETCHES OFF TO THE
116	NORTHEAST.  AT YOUR FEET IS A LARGE
116	STEEL GRATE, NEXT TO WHICH IS A SIGN
116	WHICH READS, "TREASURE VAULT. KEYS IN
116	MAIN OFFICE."
117	YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF A LARGE, DEEP
117	CHASM.  A HEAVY WHITE MIST RISING UP
117	FROM BELOW OBSCURES ALL VIEW OF THE FAR
117	SIDE.  A SW PATH LEADS AWAY FROM THE
117	CHASM INTO A WINDING CORRIDOR.
118	YOU ARE IN A LONG WINDING CORRIDOR
118	SLOPING OUT OF SIGHT IN BOTH
118	DIRECTIONS.
119	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS
119	TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
120	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS
120	TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
121	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS
121	TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
122	YOU ARE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CHASM.
122	A NE PATH LEADS AWAY FROM THE CHASM ON
122	THIS SIDE.
123	YOU'RE IN A LONG EAST/WEST CORRIDOR.  A
123	FAINT RUMBLING NOISE CAN BE HEARD IN
123	THE DISTANCE.
124	THE PATH FORKS HERE.  THE LEFT FORK
124	LEADS NORTHEAST.  A DULL RUMBLING SEEMS
124	TO GET LOUDER IN THAT DIRECTION.  THE
124	RIGHT FORK LEADS SOUTHEAST DOWN A
124	GENTLE SLOPE.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR ENTERS
124	FROM THE WEST.
125	THE WALLS ARE QUITE WARM HERE.  FROM
125	THE NORTH CAN BE HEARD A STEADY ROAR,
125	SO LOUD THAT THE ENTIRE CAVE SEEMS TO
125	BE TREMBLING.  ANOTHER PASSAGE LEADS
125	SOUTH, AND A LOW CRAWL GOES EAST.
126	YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF A BREATH-TAKING
126	VIEW.  FAR BELOW YOU IS AN ACTIVE
126	VOLCANO, FROM WHICH GREAT GOUTS OF
126	MOLTEN LAVA COME SURGING OUT, CASCADING
126	BACK DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS.  THE GLOWING
126	ROCK FILLS THE FARTHEST REACHES OF THE
126	CAVERN WITH A BLOOD-RED GLARE, GIVING
126	EVERYTHING AN EERIE, MACABRE
126	APPEARANCE.  THE AIR IS FILLED WITH
126	FLICKERING SPARKS OF ASH AND A HEAVY
126	SMELL OF BRIMSTONE.  THE WALLS ARE HOT
126	TO THE TOUCH, AND THE THUNDERING OF THE
126	VOLCANO DROWNS OUT ALL OTHER SOUNDS.
126	EMBEDDED IN THE JAGGED ROOF FAR
126	OVERHEAD ARE MYRIAD TWISTED FORMATIONS
126	COMPOSED OF PURE WHITE ALABASTER, WHICH
126	SCATTER THE MURKY LIGHT INTO SINISTER
126	APPARITIONS UPON THE WALLS.  TO ONE
126	SIDE IS A DEEP GORGE, FILLED WITH A
126	BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH
126	SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL
126	HIMSELF.  AN IMMENSE RIVER OF FIRE
126	CRASHES OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE
126	VOLCANO, BURNS ITS WAY THROUGH THE
126	GORGE, AND PLUMMETS INTO A BOTTOMLESS
126	PIT FAR OFF TO YOUR LEFT.  TO THE
126	RIGHT, AN IMMENSE GEYSER OF BLISTERING
126	STEAM ERUPTS CONTINUOUSLY FROM A BARREN
126	ISLAND IN THE CENTER OF A SULFUROUS
126	LAKE, WHICH BUBBLES OMINOUSLY.  THE FAR
126	RIGHT WALL IS AFLAME WITH AN
126	INCANDESCENCE OF ITS OWN, WHICH LENDS
126	AN ADDITIONAL INFERNAL SPLENDOR TO THE
126	ALREADY HELLISH SCENE.  A DARK,
126	FOREBODING PASSAGE EXITS TO THE SOUTH.
127	YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER FILLED WITH
127	LARGE BOULDERS.  THE WALLS ARE VERY
127	WARM, CAUSING THE AIR IN THE ROOM TO BE
127	ALMOST STIFLING FROM THE HEAT.  THE
127	ONLY EXIT IS A CRAWL HEADING WEST,
127	THROUGH WHICH IS COMING A LOW RUMBLING.
128	YOU ARE WALKING ALONG A GENTLY SLOPING
128	NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE LINED WITH ODDLY
128	SHAPED LIMESTONE FORMATIONS.
129	YOU ARE STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO A
129	LARGE, BARREN ROOM.  A SIGN POSTED
129	ABOVE THE ENTRANCE READS:  "CAUTION!
129	BEAR IN ROOM!"
130	YOU ARE INSIDE A BARREN ROOM.  THE
130	CENTER OF THE ROOM IS COMPLETELY EMPTY
130	EXCEPT FOR SOME DUST.  MARKS IN THE
130	DUST LEAD AWAY TOWARD THE FAR END OF
130	THE ROOM.  THE ONLY EXIT IS THE WAY
130	YOU CAME IN.

1	SOMEWHERE NEARBY IS COLOSSAL CAVE,
1	WHERE OTHERS HAVE FOUND FORTUNES IN
1	TREASURE AND GOLD, THOUGH IT IS RUMORED
1	THAT SOME WHO ENTER ARE NEVER SEEN
1	AGAIN.  MAGIC IS SAID TO WORK IN THE
1	CAVE.  I WILL BE YOUR EYES AND HANDS.
1	DIRECT ME WITH COMMANDS OF 1 OR 2
1	WORDS.  I SHOULD WARN YOU THAT I LOOK
1	AT ONLY THE FIRST FIVE LETTERS OF EACH
1	WORD, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO ENTER
1	"NORTHEAST" AS "NE" TO DISTINGUISH IT
1	FROM "NORTH". (SHOULD YOU GET STUCK,
1	TYPE "HELP" FOR SOME GENERAL HINTS.
1	FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO END YOUR
1	ADVENTURE, ETC., TYPE "INFO".)
1	                - - -
1	THIS PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED
1	BY WILLIE CROWTHER.  MOST OF THE
1	FEATURES OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM WERE
1	ADDED BY DON WOODS (DON @ SU-AI).
1	CONTACT DON IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
1	COMMENTS, ETC.
2	A LITTLE DWARF WITH A BIG KNIFE BLOCKS
2	YOUR WAY.
3	A LITTLE DWARF JUST WALKED AROUND A
3	CORNER, SAW YOU, THREW A LITTLE AXE AT
3	YOU WHICH MISSED, CURSED, AND RAN AWAY.
4	THERE IS A THREATENING LITTLE DWARF IN
4	THE ROOM WITH YOU!
5	ONE SHARP NASTY KNIFE IS THROWN AT YOU!
6	NONE OF THEM HIT YOU!
7	ONE OF THEM GETS YOU!
8	A HOLLOW VOICE SAYS "PLUGH".
9	THERE IS NO WAY TO GO THAT DIRECTION.
10	I AM UNSURE HOW YOU ARE FACING.  USE
10	COMPASS POINTS OR NEARBY OBJECTS.
11	I DON'T KNOW IN FROM OUT HERE.  USE
11	COMPASS POINTS OR NAME SOMETHING IN THE
11	GENERAL DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO.
12	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY THAT WORD
12	HERE.
13	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT!
14	I'M GAME.  WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN
14	HOW?
15	SORRY, BUT I AM NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE
15	MORE DETAIL.  I WILL REPEAT THE LONG
15	DESCRIPTION OF YOUR LOCATION.
16	IT IS NOW PITCH DARK.  IF YOU PROCEED
16	YOU WILL LIKELY FALL INTO A PIT.
17	IF YOU PREFER, SIMPLY TYPE W RATHER
17	THAN WEST.
18	ARE YOU TRYING TO CATCH THE BIRD?
19	THE BIRD IS FRIGHTENED RIGHT NOW AND
19	YOU CANNOT CATCH IT NO MATTER WHAT YOU
19	TRY.  PERHAPS YOU MIGHT TRY LATER.
20	ARE YOU TRYING TO SOMEHOW DEAL WITH THE
20	SNAKE?
21	YOU CAN'T KILL THE SNAKE, OR DRIVE IT
21	AWAY, OR AVOID IT, OR ANYTHING LIKE
21	THAT.  THERE IS A WAY TO GET BY, BUT
21	YOU DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES
21	RIGHT NOW.
22	DO YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT NOW?
23	YOU FELL INTO A PIT AND BROKE EVERY
23	BONE IN YOUR BODY!
24	YOU ARE ALREADY CARRYING IT!
25	YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!
26	THE BIRD WAS UNAFRAID WHEN YOU ENTERED,
26	BUT AS YOU APPROACH IT BECOMES
26	DISTURBED AND YOU CANNOT CATCH IT.
27	YOU CAN CATCH THE BIRD, BUT YOU CANNOT
27	CARRY IT.
28	THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH A LOCK!
29	YOU AREN'T CARRYING IT!
30	THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN
30	SNAKE, AND IN AN ASTOUNDING FLURRY
30	DRIVES THE SNAKE AWAY.
31	YOU HAVE NO KEYS!
32	IT HAS NO LOCK.
33	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOCK OR UNLOCK SUCH
33	A THING.
34	IT WAS ALREADY LOCKED.
35	THE GRATE IS NOW LOCKED.
36	THE GRATE IS NOW UNLOCKED.
37	IT WAS ALREADY UNLOCKED.
38	YOU HAVE NO SOURCE OF LIGHT.
39	YOUR LAMP IS NOW ON.
40	YOUR LAMP IS NOW OFF.
41	THERE IS NO WAY TO GET PAST THE BEAR
41	TO UNLOCK THE CHAIN, WHICH IS PROBABLY
41	JUST AS WELL.
42	NOTHING HAPPENS.
43	WHERE?
44	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO ATTACK.
45	THE LITTLE BIRD IS NOW DEAD.  ITS BODY
45	DISAPPEARS.
46	ATTACKING THE SNAKE BOTH DOESN'T WORK
46	AND IS VERY DANGEROUS.
47	YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.
48	YOU ATTACK A LITTLE DWARF, BUT HE
48	DODGES OUT OF THE WAY.
49	WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?
50	GOOD TRY, BUT THAT IS AN OLD WORN-OUT
50	MAGIC WORD.
51	I KNOW OF PLACES, ACTIONS, AND THINGS.
51	MOST OF MY VOCABULARY DESCRIBES PLACES
51	AND IS USED TO MOVE YOU THERE.  TO
51	MOVE, TRY WORDS LIKE FOREST, BUILDING,
51	DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH,
51	SOUTH, UP, OR DOWN.  I KNOW ABOUT A FEW
51	SPECIAL OBJECTS, LIKE A BLACK ROD
51	HIDDEN IN THE CAVE.  THESE OBJECTS CAN
51	BE MANIPULATED USING SOME OF THE ACTION
51	WORDS THAT I KNOW.  USUALLY YOU WILL
51	NEED TO GIVE BOTH THE OBJECT AND ACTION
51	WORDS (IN EITHER ORDER), BUT SOMETIMES
51	I CAN INFER THE OBJECT FROM THE VERB
51	ALONE.  SOME OBJECTS ALSO IMPLY VERBS;
51	IN PARTICULAR, "INVENTORY" IMPLIES
51	"TAKE INVENTORY", WHICH CAUSES ME TO
51	GIVE YOU A LIST OF WHAT YOU'RE
51	CARRYING.  THE OBJECTS HAVE SIDE
51	EFFECTS; FOR INSTANCE, THE ROD SCARES
51	THE BIRD.  USUALLY PEOPLE HAVING
51	TROUBLE MOVING JUST NEED TO TRY A FEW
51	MORE WORDS.  USUALLY PEOPLE TRYING
51	UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT
51	ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING BEYOND THEIR
51	(OR MY!) CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD TRY A
51	COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TACK.  TO SPEED
51	THE GAME YOU CAN SOMETIMES MOVE LONG
51	DISTANCES WITH A SINGLE WORD.  FOR
51	EXAMPLE, "BUILDING" USUALLY GETS YOU TO
51	THE BUILDING FROM ANYWHERE ABOVE GROUND
51	EXCEPT WHEN LOST IN THE FOREST.  ALSO,
51	NOTE THAT CAVE PASSAGES TURN A LOT, AND
51	THAT LEAVING A ROOM TO THE NORTH DOES
51	NOT GUARANTEE ENTERING THE NEXT FROM
51	THE SOUTH.  GOOD LUCK!
52	IT MISSES!
53	IT GETS YOU!
54	OK
55	YOU CAN'T UNLOCK THE KEYS.
56	YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE
56	HOLES AND WOUND UP BACK IN THE MAIN
56	PASSAGE.
57	I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CAVE IS, BUT
57	HEREABOUTS NO STREAM CAN RUN ON THE
57	SURFACE FOR LONG.  I WOULD TRY THE
57	STREAM.
58	I NEED MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO DO
58	THAT.
59	I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU SEE AS YOU
59	MOVE ABOUT AND MANIPULATE THINGS.  I
59	CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE REMOTE THINGS ARE.
60	I DON'T KNOW THAT WORD.
61	WHAT?
62	ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO THE CAVE?
63	THE GRATE IS VERY SOLID AND HAS A
63	HARDENED STEEL LOCK.  YOU CANNOT ENTER
63	WITHOUT A KEY, AND THERE ARE NO KEYS
63	NEARBY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING
63	ELSEWHERE FOR THE KEYS.
64	THE TREES OF THE FOREST ARE LARGE
64	HARDWOOD OAK AND MAPLE, WITH AN
64	OCCASIONAL GROVE OF PINE OR SPRUCE.
64	THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF UNDERGROWTH,
64	LARGELY BIRCH AND ASH SAPLINGS PLUS
64	NONDESCRIPT BUSHES OF VARIOUS SORTS.
64	THIS TIME OF YEAR VISIBILITY IS QUITE
64	RESTRICTED BY ALL THE LEAVES, BUT
64	TRAVEL IS QUITE EASY IF YOU DETOUR
64	AROUND THE SPRUCE AND BERRY BUSHES.
65	WELCOME TO ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE
65	INSTRUCTIONS?
66	DIGGING WITHOUT A SHOVEL IS QUITE
66	IMPRACTICAL.  EVEN WITH A SHOVEL
66	PROGRESS IS UNLIKELY.
67	BLASTING REQUIRES DYNAMITE.
68	I'M AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE.
69	MIST IS A WHITE VAPOR, USUALLY WATER,
69	SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN CAVERNS.  IT
69	CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE BUT IS FREQUENTLY
69	A SIGN OF A DEEP PIT LEADING DOWN TO
69	WATER.
70	YOUR FEET ARE NOW WET.
71	I THINK I JUST LOST MY APPETITE.
72	THANK YOU, IT WAS DELICIOUS!
73	YOU HAVE TAKEN A DRINK FROM THE STREAM.
73	THE WATER TASTES STRONGLY OF MINERALS,
73	BUT IS NOT UNPLEASANT.  IT IS EXTREMELY
73	COLD.
74	THE BOTTLE OF WATER IS NOW EMPTY.
75	RUBBING THE ELECTRIC LAMP IS NOT
75	PARTICULARLY REWARDING.  ANYWAY,
75	NOTHING EXCITING HAPPENS.
76	PECULIAR.  NOTHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS.
77	YOUR BOTTLE IS EMPTY AND THE GROUND IS
77	WET.
78	YOU CAN'T POUR THAT.
79	WATCH IT!
80	WHICH WAY?
81	OH DEAR, YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN
81	YOURSELF KILLED.  I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
81	HELP YOU OUT, BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY
81	DONE THIS BEFORE.  DO YOU WANT ME TO
81	TRY TO REINCARNATE YOU?
82	ALL RIGHT.  BUT DON'T BLAME ME IF
82	SOMETHING GOES WR......
82			   --- POOF!! ---
82	YOU ARE ENGULFED IN A CLOUD OF ORANGE
82	SMOKE.  COUGHING AND GASPING, YOU
82	EMERGE FROM THE SMOKE AND FIND....
83	YOU CLUMSY OAF, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN!
83	I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN KEEP THIS
83	UP.  DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY
83	REINCARNATING YOU AGAIN?
84	OKAY, NOW WHERE DID I PUT MY ORANGE
84	SMOKE?....  >POOF!<   EVERYTHING
84	DISAPPEARS IN A DENSE CLOUD OF ORANGE
84	SMOKE.
85	NOW YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT!  I'M OUT OF
85	ORANGE SMOKE!  YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO
85	DO A DECENT REINCARNATION WITHOUT ANY
85	ORANGE SMOKE, DO YOU?
86	OKAY, IF YOU'RE SO SMART, DO IT
86	YOURSELF!  I'M LEAVING!
90	>>> MESSAGES 81 THRU 90 ARE RESERVED
90	FOR "OBITUARIES". <<<
91	SORRY, BUT I NO LONGER SEEM TO REMEMBER
91	HOW IT WAS YOU GOT HERE.
92	YOU CAN'T CARRY ANYTHING MORE.  YOU'LL
92	HAVE TO DROP SOMETHING FIRST.  YOU
92	CAN'T GO THROUGH A LOCKED STEEL GRATE!
94	I BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT HERE
94	WITH YOU.
95	YOU DON'T FIT THROUGH A TWO-INCH SLIT!
96	I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST YOU GO ACROSS
96	THE BRIDGE INSTEAD OF JUMPING.
97	THERE IS NO WAY ACROSS THE FISSURE.
98	YOU'RE NOT CARRYING ANYTHING.
99	YOU ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING THE
99	FOLLOWING:
100	IT'S NOT HUNGRY (IT'S MERELY PININ' FOR
100	THE FJORDS).  BESIDES, YOU HAVE NO BIRD
100	SEED.
101	THE SNAKE HAS NOW DEVOURED YOUR BIRD.
102	THERE'S NOTHING HERE IT WANTS TO EAT
102	(EXCEPT PERHAPS YOU).
103	YOU FOOL, DWARVES EAT ONLY COAL!  NOW
103	YOU'VE MADE HIM *REALLY* MAD!!
104	YOU HAVE NOTHING IN WHICH TO CARRY IT.
105	YOUR BOTTLE IS ALREADY FULL.
106	THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO
106	FILL THE BOTTLE.
107	YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF WATER.
108	YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF OIL.
109	YOU CAN'T FILL THAT.
110	DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!
111	THE DOOR IS EXTREMELY RUSTY AND REFUSES
111	TO OPEN.
112	THE PLANT INDIGNANTLY SHAKES THE OIL
112	OFF ITS LEAVES AND ASKS, "WATER?"
113	THE HINGES ARE QUITE THOROUGHLY RUSTED
113	NOW AND WON'T BUDGE.
114	THE OIL HAS FREED UP THE HINGES SO THAT
114	THE DOOR WILL NOW MOVE, ALTHOUGH IT
114	REQUIRES SOME EFFORT.
115	THE PLANT HAS EXCEPTIONALLY DEEP ROOTS
115	AND CANNOT BE PULLED FREE.
116	THE DWARVES' KNIVES VANISH AS THEY
116	STRIKE THE WALLS OF THE CAVE.
117	SOMETHING YOU'RE CARRYING WON'T FIT
117	THROUGH THE TUNNEL WITH YOU.  YOU'D
117	BEST TAKE INVENTORY AND DROP SOMETHING.
118	YOU CAN'T FIT THIS FIVE-FOOT CLAM
118	THROUGH THAT LITTLE PASSAGE!
119	YOU CAN'T FIT THIS FIVE-FOOT OYSTER
119	THROUGH THAT LITTLE PASSAGE!
120	I ADVISE YOU TO PUT DOWN THE CLAM
120	BEFORE OPENING IT.  >STRAIN!<
121	I ADVISE YOU TO PUT DOWN THE OYSTER
121	BEFORE OPENING IT.	>WRENCH!<
122	YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING STRONG ENOUGH
122	TO OPEN THE CLAM.
123	YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING STRONG ENOUGH
123	TO OPEN THE OYSTER.
124	A GLISTENING PEARL FALLS OUT OF THE
124	CLAM AND ROLLS AWAY.  GOODNESS,
124	THIS MUST REALLY BE AN OYSTER.  (I
124	NEVER WAS VERY GOOD AT IDENTIFYING
124	BIVALVES.)  WHATEVER IT IS, IT HAS NOW
124	SNAPPED SHUT AGAIN.
125	THE OYSTER CREAKS OPEN, REVEALING
125	NOTHING BUT OYSTER INSIDE.  IT PROMPTLY
125	SNAPS SHUT AGAIN.
126	YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE
126	HOLES AND FOUND YOUR WAY BLOCKED BY A
126	RECENT CAVE-IN.  YOU ARE NOW BACK IN
126	THE MAIN PASSAGE.
127	THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM
127	THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.
128	OUT FROM THE SHADOWS BEHIND YOU POUNCES
128	A BEARDED PIRATE!  "HAR, HAR," HE
128	CHORTLES, "I'LL JUST TAKE ALL THIS
128	BOOTY AND HIDE IT AWAY WITH ME CHEST
128	DEEP IN THE MAZE!"  HE SNATCHES YOUR
128	TREASURE AND VANISHES INTO THE GLOOM.
129	A SEPULCHRAL VOICE REVERBERATING
129	THROUGH THE CAVE, SAYS, "CAVE CLOSING
129	SOON.  ALL ADVENTURERS EXIT IMMEDIATELY
129	THROUGH MAIN OFFICE."
130	A MYSTERIOUS RECORDED VOICE GROANS INTO
130	LIFE AND ANNOUNCES: "THIS EXIT IS
130	CLOSED.  PLEASE LEAVE VIA MAIN OFFICE."
131	IT LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU'RE DEAD.  WELL,
131	SEEING AS HOW IT'S SO CLOSE TO CLOSING
131	TIME ANYWAY, I THINK WE'LL JUST CALL IT
131	A DAY.
132	THE SEPULCHRAL VOICE ENTONES, "THE CAVE
132	IS NOW CLOSED."  AS THE ECHOES FADE,
132	THERE IS A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT (AND
132	A SMALL PUFF OF ORANGE SMOKE). . . . AS
132	YOUR EYES REFOCUS, YOU LOOK AROUND AND
132	FIND...
133	THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND A
133	TWENTY-FOOT HOLE APPEARS IN THE FAR
133	WALL, BURYING THE DWARVES IN THE
133	RUBBLE.  YOU MARCH THROUGH THE HOLE AND
133	FIND YOURSELF IN THE MAIN OFFICE, WHERE
133	A CHEERING BAND OF FRIENDLY ELVES CARRY
133	THE CONQUERING ADVENTURER OFF INTO THE
133	SUNSET.
134	THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND A
134	TWENTY-FOOT HOLE APPEARS IN THE FAR
134	WALL, BURYING THE SNAKES IN THE RUBBLE.
134	A RIVER OF MOLTEN LAVA POURS IN THROUGH
134	THE HOLE, DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN ITS
134	PATH, INCLUDING YOU!
135	THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND YOU ARE
135	SUDDENLY SPLASHED ACROSS THE WALLS OF
135	THE ROOM.
136	THE RESULTING RUCKUS HAS AWAKENED THE
136	DWARVES.  THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL
136	THREATENING LITTLE DWARVES IN THE ROOM
136	WITH YOU!  MOST OF THEM THROW KNIVES AT
136	YOU!  ALL OF THEM GET YOU!
137	OH, LEAVE THE POOR UNHAPPY BIRD ALONE.
138	I DARESAY WHATEVER YOU WANT IS AROUND
138	HERE SOMEWHERE.
139	I DON'T KNOW THE WORD "STOP".  USE
139	"QUIT" IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP.
140	YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE.
141	YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED BY A VERY LARGE,
141	TAME BEAR.
142	IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR ADVENTURE
142	EARLY, SAY "QUIT".  TO SUSPEND YOUR
142	ADVENTURE SUCH THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE
142	LATER, SAY "SUSPEND" (OR "PAUSE" OR
142	"SAVE").  TO SEE WHAT HOURS THE CAVE
142	IS NORMALLY OPEN, SAY "HOURS".  TO SEE
142	HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING, SAY "SCORE".  TO
142	GET FULL CREDIT FOR A TREASURE, YOU
142	MUST HAVE LEFT IT SAFELY IN THE
142	BUILDING, THOUGH YOU GET PARTIAL CREDIT
142	JUST FOR LOCATING IT.  YOU LOSE POINTS
142	FOR GETTING KILLED, OR FOR QUITTING,
142	THOUGH THE FORMER COSTS YOU MORE.
142	THERE ARE ALSO POINTS BASED ON HOW MUCH
142	(IF ANY) OF THE CAVE YOU'VE MANAGED TO
142	EXPLORE; IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS A
142	LARGE BONUS JUST FOR GETTING IN (TO
142	DISTINGUISH THE BEGINNERS FROM THE REST
142	OF THE PACK), AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
142	TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN
142	THROUGH SOME OF THE MORE HARROWING
142	SECTIONS.  IF YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND
142	ALL THE TREASURES, JUST KEEP EXPLORING
142	FOR A WHILE.  IF NOTHING INTERESTING
142	HAPPENS, YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THEM ALL
142	YET.  IF SOMETHING INTERESTING *DOES*
142	HAPPEN, IT MEANS YOU'RE GETTING A BONUS
142	AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GARNER MANY
142	MORE POINTS IN THE MASTER'S SECTION.
142	I MAY OCCASIONALLY OFFER HINTS IF YOU
142	SEEM TO BE HAVING TROUBLE.  IF I DO,
142	I'LL WARN YOU IN ADVANCE HOW MUCH IT
142	WILL AFFECT YOUR SCORE TO ACCEPT THE
142	HINTS.  FINALLY, TO SAVE PAPER, YOU MAY
142	SPECIFY "BRIEF", WHICH TELLS ME NEVER
142	TO REPEAT THE FULL DESCRIPTION OF A
142	PLACE UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY ASK ME TO.
143	DO YOU INDEED WISH TO QUIT NOW?
144	THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO
144	FILL THE VASE.
145	THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE HAS
145	DELICATELY SHATTERED THE VASE.
146	IT IS BEYOND YOUR POWER TO DO THAT.
147	I DON'T KNOW HOW.
148	IT IS TOO FAR UP FOR YOU TO REACH.
149	YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.  THE BODY
149	VANISHES IN A CLOUD OF GREASY
149	BLACK SMOKE.
150	THE SHELL IS VERY STRONG AND IS
150	IMPERVIOUS TO ATTACK.
151	WHAT'S THE MATTER, CAN'T YOU READ?  NOW
151	YOU'D BEST START OVER.
152	THE AXE BOUNCES HARMLESSLY OFF THE
152	DRAGON'S THICK SCALES.
153	THE DRAGON LOOKS RATHER NASTY.  YOU'D
153	BEST NOT TRY TO GET BY.
154	THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN
154	DRAGON, AND IN AN ASTOUNDING FLURRY
154	GETS BURNT TO A CINDER.  THE ASHES BLOW
154	AWAY.
155	ON WHAT?
156	OKAY, FROM NOW ON I'LL ONLY DESCRIBE A
156	PLACE IN FULL THE FIRST TIME YOU COME
156	TO IT.  TO GET THE FULL DESCRIPTION,
156	SAY "LOOK".
157	TROLLS ARE CLOSE RELATIVES WITH THE
157	ROCKS AND HAVE SKIN AS TOUGH AS THAT OF
157	A RHINOCEROS.  THE TROLL FENDS OFF YOUR
157	BLOWS EFFORTLESSLY.
158	THE TROLL DEFTLY CATCHES THE AXE,
158	EXAMINES IT CAREFULLY, AND TOSSES IT
158	BACK, DECLARING, "GOOD WORKMANSHIP, BUT
158	IT'S NOT VALUABLE ENOUGH."
159	THE TROLL CATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND
159	SCURRIES AWAY OUT OF SIGHT.
160	THE TROLL REFUSES TO LET YOU CROSS.
161	THERE IS NO LONGER ANY WAY ACROSS THE
161	CHASM.
162	JUST AS YOU REACH THE OTHER SIDE, THE
162	BRIDGE BUCKLES BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF
162	THE BEAR, WHICH WAS STILL FOLLOWING YOU
162	AROUND.  YOU SCRABBLE DESPERATELY FOR
162	SUPPORT, BUT AS THE BRIDGE COLLAPSES
162	YOU STUMBLE BACK AND FALL INTO THE
162	CHASM.
163	THE BEAR LUMBERS TOWARD THE TROLL, WHO
163	LETS OUT A STARTLED SHRIEK AND SCURRIES
163	AWAY.  THE BEAR SOON GIVES UP THE
163	PURSUIT AND WANDERS BACK.
164	THE AXE MISSES AND LANDS NEAR THE BEAR
164	WHERE YOU CAN'T GET AT IT.
165	WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?  AGAINST
165	*HIS* BEAR HANDS??
166	THE BEAR IS CONFUSED; HE ONLY WANTS TO
166	BE YOUR FRIEND.
167	FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, THE POOR THING IS
167	ALREADY DEAD!
168	THE BEAR EAGERLY WOLFS DOWN YOUR FOOD,
168	AFTER WHICH HE SEEMS TO CALM DOWN
168	CONSIDERABLY AND EVEN BECOMES RATHER
168	FRIENDLY.
169	THE BEAR IS STILL CHAINED TO THE WALL.
170	THE CHAIN IS STILL LOCKED.
171	THE CHAIN IS NOW UNLOCKED.
172	THE CHAIN IS NOW LOCKED.
173	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO WHICH THE
173	CHAIN CAN BE LOCKED.
174	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO EAT.
175	DO YOU WANT THE HINT?
176	DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF THE
176	MAZE?
177	YOU CAN MAKE THE PASSAGES LOOK LESS
177	ALIKE BY DROPPING THINGS.
178	ARE YOU TRYING TO EXPLORE BEYOND THE
178	PLOVER ROOM?
179	THERE IS A WAY TO EXPLORE THAT REGION
179	WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT FALLING
179	INTO A PIT.  NONE OF THE OBJECTS
179	AVAILABLE IS IMMEDIATELY USEFUL IN
179	DISCOVERING THE SECRET.
180	DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF HERE?
181	DON'T GO WEST.
182	GLUTTONY IS NOT ONE OF THE TROLL'S
182	VICES.  AVARICE, HOWEVER, IS.
183	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST
183	START WRAPPING THIS UP, UNLESS YOU CAN
183	FIND SOME FRESH BATTERIES.  I SEEM TO
183	RECALL THERE'S A VENDING MACHINE IN THE
183	MAZE.  BRING SOME COINS WITH YOU.
184	YOUR LAMP HAS RUN OUT OF POWER.
185	THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN WANDERING
185	AROUND OUT HERE, AND YOU CAN'T EXPLORE
185	THE CAVE WITHOUT A LAMP.  SO LET'S JUST
185	CALL IT A DAY.
186	THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM
186	THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.  AS YOU TURN
186	TOWARD THEM, THE BEAM OF YOUR LAMP
186	FALLS ACROSS A BEARDED PIRATE.  HE IS
186	CARRYING A LARGE CHEST.  "SHIVER ME
186	TIMBERS!" HE CRIES, "I'VE BEEN SPOTTED!
186	I'D BEST HIE MESELF OFF TO THE MAZE TO
186	HIDE ME CHEST!"  WITH THAT, HE VANISHES
186	INTO THE GLOOM.
187	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST
187	GO BACK FOR THOSE BATTERIES.
188	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  I'M TAKING
188	THE LIBERTY OF REPLACING THE BATTERIES.
189	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM, AND YOU'RE
189	OUT OF SPARE BATTERIES.  YOU'D BEST
189	START WRAPPING THIS UP.
190	I'M AFRAID THE MAGAZINE IS WRITTEN IN
190	DWARVISH.
191	"THIS IS NOT THE MAZE WHERE THE PIRATE
191	LEAVES HIS TREASURE CHEST."
192	HMMM, THIS LOOKS LIKE A CLUE, WHICH
192	MEANS IT'LL COST YOU 10 POINTS TO READ
192	IT.  SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND READ IT
192	ANYWAY?
193	IT SAYS, "THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE
193	ABOUT THIS PLACE, SUCH THAT ONE OF THE
193	WORDS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN NOW HAS A NEW
193	EFFECT."
194	IT SAYS THE SAME THING IT DID BEFORE.
195	I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
196	"CONGRATULATIONS ON BRINGING LIGHT INTO
196	THE DARK-ROOM!"
197	YOU STRIKE THE MIRROR A RESOUNDING
197	BLOW, WHEREUPON IT SHATTERS INTO A
197	MYRIAD TINY FRAGMENTS.
198	YOU HAVE TAKEN THE VASE AND HURLED IT
198	DELICATELY TO THE GROUND.  YOU PROD THE
198	NEAREST DWARF, WHO WAKES UP GRUMPILY,
198	TAKES ONE LOOK AT YOU, CURSES, AND
198	GRABS FOR HIS AXE.
200	IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?
201	THERE'S NO POINT IN SUSPENDING A
201	DEMONSTRATION GAME.

1	A LARGE CLOUD OF GREEN SMOKE APPEARS IN
1	FRONT OF YOU.  IT CLEARS AWAY TO REVEAL
1	A TALL WIZARD, CLOTHED IN GREY.  HE
1	FIXES YOU WITH A STEELY GLARE AND
1	DECLARES, "THIS ADVENTURE HAS LASTED
1	TOO LONG."  WITH THAT HE MAKES A SINGLE
1	PASS OVER YOU WITH HIS HANDS, AND
1	EVERYTHING AROUND YOU FADES AWAY INTO A
1	GREY NOTHINGNESS.
2	EVEN WIZARDS HAVE TO WAIT LONGER THAN
2	THAT!
